# Movie Production Investment - Data Science Capstone Project
## What is this about?
For the end of a 3 months immersive course in Data Science, I have worked on a Movie Production Investment project to predict movies that would be successful or have a high review score. With the increase of streaming platforms and the consumption of movies as “fast” culture, I want to analyse a regression and classification model focused on budget, tagline, IMDb voting of films.

This would be targeted to cultural investors, corporates interested in investing in the arts, film production companies, government cultural departments or even film councils and festivals.

The success metrics would be revenue, ROI, IMDb score and valid investment.

Apart from the regression and classification models to determine, I will also use an NLP to review which keywords are more likely used in successful movies.
